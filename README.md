🚀 Getting Started


Set up the database
Run backend/schema.sql in MySQL to create the database and tables.
Configure your credentials


bash   cp backend/config.example.py backend/config.py

Then edit backend/config.py with your own MySQL password and a random secret key.


Install dependencies


bash   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the server


bash   python app.py


Open the app
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 — you'll be redirected to the login/register page. Create an account and you're in! 🎉



🔒 Security Note

backend/config.py is excluded from version control via .gitignore since it holds your database password and secret key. Never commit real credentials — always work off config.example.py.
